Hello.

This is the code repository for the Standard Information Sharing Label, or Standard Label for short. You can find more information at http://standardlabel.org 

The most interesting (and functional) code on here is the addon, in the addon directory.

You'll have to download it and install it from developer mode in Chrome. Just point chrome to the plugin directory and it should just work.

Note, however, it will only actually work on the Facebook Guardian App permissions page. There is also a FB test page included, which has its own instructions on how to make it work in the page itself (addon/test.FB.OAuth.htm).
 
This repo is about developing code publicly rather than shipping early. 

This is *not* a "released" product.
