Hello.

This is the code repository for the Standard Information Sharing Label, or Standard Label for short. You can find more information at http://standardlabel.org 

The most interesting (and functional) code on here is the addon, in the addon directory.

You'll have to download it and install it from developer mode in Chrome. Just point chrome to the plugin directory and it should just work.

Note, however, it will only actually work on Google Search and the Facebook Guardian App permissions page. 
 
This repo is about developing code publicly rather than shipping early. 

This is *not* a "released" product.

Note also, that the 3rd Party reputation services used in The Guardian's label are "live"--in that they are pulled from a "service" on the web, but those services are mockups.  In addition, they should be driven by user configuration and NOT set by the data recipient.  But at least it shows one idea for how it should work.
