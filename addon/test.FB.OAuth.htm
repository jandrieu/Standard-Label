<h1>Facebook Style OAuth Test Page</h1>
<p>This is a test page for Facebook style OAuth requests.  Create an intercept that points to this file, either locally or remotely. Since query terms are ignored for basic html/http requests, we can load up a FB looking URL even though its our file.</p>
<p>For example, </p>
<pre>
https://www.facebook.com/dialog/oauth?client_id=180444840287&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fapps.facebook.com%2Ftheguardian%2Fauthenticated%2Fcommentisfree%2F2012%2Fjul%2F08%2Fandy-murray-not-miserable-just-normal%3Ffb_source%3Dother_multiline%26fb_action_types%3Dnews.reads&scope=publish_actions,email,user_birthday,user_location
</pre>
Is a valid FB URL for OAuth based access.
This file happens to be at 
<pre>
c:\Users\Joe\Documents\GitHub\Standard-Label\plugin\test.FB.OAuth.htm
</pre>
Which means that an intercept with the following URL can be treated as a facebook OAuth intercept:
file:///c:/Users/Joe/Documents/GitHub/Standard-Label/plugin/test.FB.OAuth.htm?client_id=180444840287&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fapps.facebook.com%2Ftheguardian%2Fauthenticated%2Fcommentisfree%2F2012%2Fjul%2F08%2Fandy-murray-not-miserable-just-normal%3Ffb_source%3Dother_multiline%26fb_action_types%3Dnews.reads&scope=publish_actions,email,user_birthday,user_location
